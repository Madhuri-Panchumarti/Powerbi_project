# FINAL PROJECT TASK 
Context

You want to create and develop your small business, and be physically located as a shop around the theme "bike". You have too little money to start your company safely.

That’s why you will be participating in a fundraising event to obtain the financial resources necessary for the start-up and development of your business. 



YOUR MISSION

Objective :  



Convince investors to bet on you by answering the following questions :



**How can a small bike store be created and developed effectively, strategically positioned in the market while maximizing investor appeal?" **



You can focus on specialization in a field (bike, accessories...) or in a specific type of practice (road, mountain...). Be creative, but remember you are a small store. A small general store can’t provide products that are popular... However, nothing prevents you from positioning yourself as a small general store... what matters is to be convincing and present good numbers of arguments based on the data set that you have available.



You will first explore the data set, in order to explore several possibilities of choice. Once you have made your choice, start developing your dashboard in order to convince investors as much as possible.



To win the odds and attract investors, you will need to make the right choices. Here are some ideas to inspire you :



- Sell profitable products

- Sell products in quantity

- Position yourself on fashionable products

- Choose a geographic location that is conducive to strong sales

- Take into account the evolution of sales trends over time

- Specialize in the sale of parts or accessories

- Specialize in young or senior targets



In addition to providing a complete analysis that will allow you to support your choices regarding the business you would like to develop, make sure to indicate precisely where you wish to be physically located. Remember that investors, who are willing to invest their money, will raise specific points to ensure your business is profitable at a certain point.  

As said above, be creative !

For example, you could indicate that you are focusing on products that only bring in small margins but by setting up in an area where there are many cycling competitions throughout the year because you are sure to have a very large number of passing customers, who always needs to renew this or that accéssoire before competition...  



Do not fail to build your arguments, and be sparkling on D-day ;)
